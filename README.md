# Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning
Hello, Soumyadeep here. Using Tensorflow and the Convolutional Neural Network method, I created a classification system for cats and dogs.

So,I have imported dataset from using API command.

I resized the image shape as (150,150)

Used Keras,sequential

Utilised these layers: Flatten, BatchNormalization, Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout

I used the softmax function and catergorical cross entropy loss to run 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.

# So, the model accuracy is 99%
# Validation accuracy is 97%

In Prediction, the Cat is represent as 0 and Dog is represent as 1
